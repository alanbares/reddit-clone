# reddit-clone

My first project done from scratch without a direct tutorial. Built with angular 1.4x and legacy firebase. It is a reddit clone that includes the ability to add posts that are tied to a unique user. Each user is assigned a unique id upon registration.  App currently has features such as password reset, password change, and a simple upvote and downvote system. 

Password reset and password change are currentlly functional but are not yet available to the view as they are currently console logs if a promise resolves. In the future I plan to add a proper ui and allow for each user post to be made viewable whether a user is logged in or not. I would also like to add a proper data structure for votes and tie any upvote or downvote to each uniquer user. And I also plan on adding a comment feature for posts and moving the app to the new firebase.
